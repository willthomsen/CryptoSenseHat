# CryptoSenseHat
Just a basic project for me to get more familar with my RPi4, SenseHat, Python.

The reason I bought that was when originally playing with the SenseHat. 
The CPU of the PI was throwing off the temperatures, so I desided to keep it off the top of the pi.
Lastly you will see in my code I use Sense.set_rotation(180). With the GPIO spliter your sensehat will be upside down so you have to compensate with this rotation. The buttons are not rotated.

So whenever you program the event direction it will be the reverse. 

Up=Down
Left=Right
Right=Left
Down=Up

Also please note, I am no artist. My pixels image are probably going to be really bad. I will try my best, but if you can improve then go ahead. 


As of 5/5/2021, I have only programmed DOGE coin fully.
